# School Remind Me (simple local web app)

## Run it
1) Unzip
2) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click)

That’s it — it saves your assignments to your browser using `localStorage`.

## Your schedule
Your timetable is in `app.js` near the top:

- `SCHEDULE.slots` controls which subject appears on each weekday/time block.
- `SUBJECT_COLORS` controls the comfy colors.

If your real schedule is different, tell me what each day looks like and I’ll adjust it.


## Phone / iPhone / Android
This is a **PWA-style** simple web app (no install needed).
- Easiest: upload the folder to any hosting (GitHub Pages / Netlify) and open the link on your phone.
- Or locally on your phone: open `index.html` from a files app (works on Android; iPhone is more limited).
Tip: in Safari/Chrome, use **“Add to Home Screen”** for an app-like icon.
