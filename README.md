# School Remind Me (simple local web app)

## Run it
1) Unzip
2) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click)

That’s it — it saves your assignments to your browser using `localStorage`.

## Your schedule
Your timetable is in `app.js` near the top:

- `SCHEDULE.slots` controls which subject appears on each weekday/time block.
- `SUBJECT_COLORS` controls the comfy colors.

If your real schedule is different, tell me what each day looks like and I’ll adjust it.
